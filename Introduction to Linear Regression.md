Linear regression is one of the easiest and most popular Machine Learning algorithms.
<b>It is a statistical method that is used for predictive analysis. Linear regression makes predictions for continuous/real or numeric variables such as sales, salary, age, product price, etc.</b>

<b>Linear regression algorithm shows a linear relationship between a dependent (y) and one or more independent (y) variables, hence called as linear regression.</b>
<b>Since linear regression shows the linear relationship, which means it finds how the value of the dependent variable is changing according to the value of the independent variable.</b>
